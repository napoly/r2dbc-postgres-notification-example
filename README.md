R2DBC Streaming of Inserted and Updated rows using Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY
=========================================================================

This example leverages Postgres `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` for inserting and updating rows.

It consists of two pieces:

* `INSERT`/`UPDATE` trigger: Every time a row in `login_event` is added or changed, it emits the row as JSON to the `login_event_notification` channel.
* Notification listener that listens to `login_event_notification` and exposes events as HTTP Server-Sent Events.

## Building from Source

To run that project, you can easily use the provided [maven wrapper](https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper).
You also need JDK 1.8.

```bash
 $ ./mvnw clean install
```

## Requirements

You need a running PostgreSQL database. One can use 'docker-compose up' which should set up postgre with needed credentials.

## Running the Application

To run that project, you can easily use the provided [maven wrapper](https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper).
You also need JDK 1.8.

```bash
 $ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

## Testing the Application

The application exposes two HTTP endpoints:

* `GET /login-stream`: Obtain the stream of login event notifications
* `POST /login/{username}`: Generate a login event

Note: This example uses `curl`.

To test the application yourself, run the application and issue the following two commands in two terminals.

**Obtain SSE stream**

```bash
 $ curl http://localhost:8080/login-stream
``` 

**Produce a login event**

```bash
 $ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/login/joe
```

In the terminal that listens to the SSE stream, you should see:

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/login-stream

data:{"id":62,"username":"joe","login_time":"2019-09-13T09:23:32.170708"}

data:{"id":63,"username":"joe","login_time":"2019-09-13T09:24:28.571422"}

data:{"id":64,"username":"joe","login_time":"2019-09-13T09:24:28.926448"}
```

Note that Postgres notifications are not persisted nor queued.

## Behind the scenes

Notifications are produced by a trigger that invokes a function. Your Postgres database gets initialized by using `schema.sql`.

R2DBC Postgres is an asynchronous/non-blocking/reactive driver that consumes asynchronous notifications and exposes these as `Flux<Notification>` on a single connection that is subscribed to the `login_event_notification` channel. 

Note: Spring uses semicolon (`;`) as statement separator. Since the trigger function uses semicolon as well, statements in `schema.sql` are separated by double semicolon (`;;`).
